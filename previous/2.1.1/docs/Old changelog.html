<strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size:xx-large"><font style="color:#f00">What is Minicraft? </font></span></strong><br>
<br>
Minicraft is a game made by Notch himself within 48 hours. It was part of the of the 22nd Ludum Dare competition. The competition required that the developer make a game in 48 hours after hearing the theme of the contest. The theme was Alone, and the idea of killing the last living person, the Air Wizard, was created.<br>
<br>
Minicraft in a nutshell is a 2-D Minecraft. You collect resources to make tools, by either mining them up or killing enemy mobs. go through the different layers to collect Iron, Gold, to eventually make a Gem Pickaxe which will allow you to brake the Hard Rock that is blocking you from entering the stairs up to the sky where the Air Wizard lies.<br>
<br>
You can play Minicraft here: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ld48/ld22/index.html" target="">https://s3.amazonaws...ld22/index.html</a><br>

<br>
<font style="color:#0000cd"><strong class="bbc"><span style="font-size:xx-large">K then, What is Minicraft+?</span></strong></font><br>
<br>
Minicraft+ is a mod of minicraft that makes minicraft more expansive and continuoes like Minecraft. I've been working on this mod since deciember 24th 2011. Since then I've added so much, Improving my Java coding every day and I'm not stopping anytime soon. I also have some help from a friend of mine (Dillyg10) who has been working with java &amp; many coding languages for years, so that is a bonus of its own. He has made Beds, Hunger system, Respawning, the upcoming skills system and some other stuff.<br>
<br>
Since 1.0 I've added:<br>
<br>
Gold Apples<br>
Tnt<br>
Iron &amp; Gold Lanterns<br>
Creepers (Thanks to Lenkyl)<br>
World Generation Options<br>
Skeletons<br>
Wool (White, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, &amp; Black)<br>
Player crafting (Press Z in-game)<br>
Housing Decoration: Wood (Plank, Plank Wall, &amp; Plank Door) &amp; Stone (Stone brick, Stone Brick Wall, Stone Door) *See 1.3 Update for more info<br>
Day/Night System<br>
Animals (Cows, Pigs, Sheep)<br>
Armor (Leather, Iron, Gold, Gem, and Scale*) *Scale armor is coming in the 1.5 update<br>
Loom (Crafting station for wool and bed)<br>
The dungeon (A new layer below the nether)<br>
2 new mobs: Snakes &amp; Knights (Only spawn in the dungeon).<br>
2 new Tools: Bows &amp; Claymores<br>
Bigger Worlds! (Part of World Generation options. You can go by normal 128x128 world, Big 256x256 (x2) world, and Huge 512x512 (4x) world)<br>
Torches<br>
and some other stuff that I can't remeber at this moment.<br>
<br>
If you don't know what to do, you can look at the tutorial here: <a href="http://minicraftplus.webs.com/Tutorial.htm" target="">http://minicraftplus...om/Tutorial.htm</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#daa520"><span style="font-size:xx-large">Where is my Save System? &gt;=(</span></font></strong><br>
<br>
Yeah I get this a lot, It's true that Minicraft+ Doesn't have a save system yet. I've attempted to make one, didn't turn out so well. Although It wont be part of the 1.5 update, Me &amp; Dillyg10 are working with Shylor (the guy who runs playminicraft.com) to make a online save system. Don't expect it too soon though, It is still in its early stages.<br>
<br>
So please, be patient with us. If you want a Minicraft mod that has saving I'd reccomend InfinityTale or Minicraft Delux over at <a href="http://playminicraft.com/" target="">http://playminicraft.com/</a>.<br>

<span style="font-size:xx-large"><font style="color:#8000ff">Version 1.6 Update!</font></span><br>
<br>
1.6 doesn't have a lot but it will keep you busy <img data-class="" src="http://media-minecraftforum.cursecdn.com/avatars/0/14/635356669596273706.png" title=":)" alt=":)" border="0"><br>
<br>
*Gave TNT a warning glow before it blows up<br>
*A new warning pops up when you try to place walls/doors in a wrong place<br>
*You can now craft double the torches/planks/stbricks/&amp; string<br>
*Fixed the day/night cycle to be 18 minutes instead of 21.6 minutes<br>
*String is a new item that is craftable in the loom with 1 wool.<br>
*Bows are now crafted from 5 wood and 2 string<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#ff0">Score Mode</font></strong></span><br>
---------------------------------------<br>
A 4th game mode is here, Score!<br>
<br>
You have 20 minutes to get the best score possible in a game. So you better rush for it! To get a lot of score, you must kill baddies. The more baddies you kill, the higher multiplier you get.(max is 50)<br>
<br>
Oh, and killing the air wizard gives you 5 million points. So good luck with that <img data-class="" src="http://media-minecraftforum.cursecdn.com/avatars/0/6/635356669595017022.png" title=";)" alt=";)" border="0"><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">Fishing:</strong></font></span><br>
--------------<br>
The fishing rod is a new item that lets you fish items from water. most of the time you will get nothing, but you can get fish that heals 1 hunger point (You can cook it for 3 points). You can also get slime and most rare, Leather armor!<br>
<br>
The fishing rod is crafted in the workbench with 5 wood and 5 string. Now this fishing rod isn't a forever use! This item is the first (Or maybe only) item to have durability. You have 15 uses, so be wise!<br>

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#ff0">Bigger Worlds:</font></strong></span><br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Worlds can now be much bigger! Just go into the World Generations menu and select up to 3 choices.<br>
<br>
Normal: 128x128 default world<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wdDsD.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Big: 256x256 (2x) world<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LOINa.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Huge: 512x512 (4x) world<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JvLFm.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">The Dungeon:</strong></font></span><br>
--------------<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3egVK.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vn7JQ.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
The dungeon is a new layer below the nether. It is home to two new mobs: Knights and Snakes.<br>
<br>
The Knights drop shards in which they are used to upgrade your sword into a claymore.<br>
<br>
The Snakes drop scales in which they are used to craft Scale armor (4 points).<br>
<br>
Obsidian walls which block the entrance can only be destroyed with a Gold/Gem pickaxe and <font style="color:#f00">after you destroy the air wizard</font>. You can also use TNT to blast through them as well, but your gonna need a lot to get through some walls in the dungeon.<br>
<br>
The dungeon doesn't have bosses yet, that will be in 1.6 though!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><font style="color:#80ff00">Torches:</font></span><br>
-------------------------<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fHvQk.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/W0gJS.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Torches are finally here! Torches allow you to light up blocks in the surface to prevent enemy mobs from spawning at night. Torches are crafted with 1 wood and 1 coal in player crafting.<br>
<br>
Now you can light up your base so mobs won't spawn in it! But watch out, you can take out torches with your fists, so be careful where you swing!<br>
<br>
Torches will only work on the surface as of this update.<br>
<br>
The only blocks not affected by torches is tilled soil and wheat tile(because I was lazy), lava, and any walls/rocks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#ffbf00">Farming with water:</font></strong></span><br>
---------------------<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/PDnoI.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Wheat will now grow twice as fast when it is next to a water tile. So no need to wait a long time for your wheat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#00bf00">Bows &amp; Arrows:</font></strong></span><br>

<br>
<img src="http://minicraftplus.webs.com/Tutorial pics/Item count 2.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Bows are a new tool that shoot arrows towards mobs to do damage. In survival mode you get 25 arrows, and in creative you get infinite to mess around with.<br>
<br>
(If you somehow get over 9999 arrows in survival it will show the infinite sign).<br>
<br>
Arrows are dropped by skeletons. Arrows do pretty much a weak amount of damage per arrow but arrows can be shot through multiple enemies if you like to train them.<br>
<br>
The bow is also a good tool to use against the air wizard when he is flying in the air.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:x-large"><font style="color:#bf4000"><strong class="bbc">Title screen Splashes:</strong></font></span><br>
----------<br>
the first thing you might notice with the update is these flashy new text on the main menu.<br>
<br>
These are just little things I add to advertise other mods and make some references to things I like.<br>
<br>
So far there are 28 splashes and 1 secret one.<br>
<br>
the 28 are:<br>
<br>
"Also play InfinityTale!"<br>
"Also play Minicraft Delux!"<br>
"Notch is Awesome!"<br>
"Dillyg10 is cool as Ice!"<br>
"Kill Creeper, get Gunpowder!"<br>
"Also play Alecraft!"<br>
"Also play Hackcraft!"<br>
"Playminicraft.com is the bomb!"<br>
"Shylor is the man!"<br>
"Kill Cow, get Beef!"<br>
"Guard13007 has too many twitters!"<br>
"You should read Antidious Venomi!"<br>
"Kill Zombie, get Cloth!"<br>
"Kill Slime, get Slime!"<br>
"Kill Skeleton, get Bones!"<br>
"Kill Sheep, get Wool!"<br>
"Kill Pig, get Porkchop!"<br>
"Gold &gt; Iron"<br>
"Gem &gt; Gold"<br>
"@MinicraftPlus on Twitter"<br>
"MinicraftPlus on Youtube"<br>
"AntVenom loves cows! Honest!"<br>
"Milk is for something later!"<br>
"saying ay-oh, that creeper's KO'd!"<br>
"So we back in the mine, pickaxe swinging from side to side"<br>
"Life itself suspended by a thread"<br>
"wenubs.com is jamming!"<br>
<br>
and the secret one:<br>
<br>
"Missingno"<br>
<br>
The only way to get the secret one is if the random generator messes up and chooses a number that is not 0-27(the 28). Which should not happen <img data-class="" src="http://media-minecraftforum.cursecdn.com/avatars/0/6/635356669595017022.png" title=";)" alt=";)" border="0"><br>

<span style="font-size:xx-large"><font style="color:#8000ff">Test 1.4 Update!</font></span><br>
<br>
After a 2 month hiatus, It's back.<br>
<br>
To help celebrate <a href="http://playminicraft.com/" target="">http://playminicraft.com/</a> version 2.0, I have updated Minicraft+ to 1.4.<br>
<br>
The Save System &amp; Torch system will not be included with this update (Sorry about that).<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:large"><font style="color:#daa520"><strong class="bbc">Creative &amp; Hardcore modes:</strong></font></span><br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Hardcore - No respawning!<br>
<br>
Creative - Basically Dillyg10's creative mode, but in Minicraft+. Has infinite placement of tiles, no hearts or hunger to worry about.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:large"><font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">Beds:</strong></font></span><br>
--------------<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/j7xCW.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Beds are a new furniture that allow you to skip the night to daytime.<br>
<br>
Beds are crafted in the Loom from 3 wool &amp; 5 planks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#008080"><span style="font-size:large">Hunger System:</span></font><br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/OqBCK.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/CYQlc.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Food no longer heals you directly anymore! What do you do? Get those hamburgers up of course!<br>
<br>
The bar heals you when it's full and hurts you when it's empty. On easy mode, it leaves 5 hearts left, on normal it leaves 3 hearts, and on Hard mode it leaves 0 (You die).<br>
<br>
Apples, raw Porkchops and Beef give 1 point.<br>
<br>
Bread gives 2 points<br>
<br>
Cooked Porkchops and steak gives 3 points<br>
<br>
Golden Apples fill all 10 points in the hunger meter<br>
<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#4b0082"><span style="font-size:large"><strong class="bbc">Armor System:</strong></span></font><br>
---------------------<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dgUcQ.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/bbr6T.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Armor is a new system that is like "Extra HP". It works like this: You have 3 HP left, with 5 Armor points. Creeper blows up near you doing 7 Damage. Your armor points take up 5 points leaving you with 1 HP left and still alive.<br>
<br>
There are 4 Types of armor: Leather, Iron, Gold, and Gem. Leather gives 3 points, Iron gives 5 points, gold gives 7 points, and gem gives you 10 points.<br>
<br>
And don't think you can just put on 2 leather armors. <strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#f00">If the armor bar has at least 1 armor point left you cannot put any other armor on.</font></strong><br>
<br>
Leather armor is made from 10 leather and is made in either the loom or a workbench.<br>
Iron armor is made from 10 Iron and is made in the Anvil.<br>
Gold armor is made from 10 Gold and is made in the Anvil.<br>
Gem armor is made from 65 Gems and is made in the Anvil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:large"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#00bf00">Animals:</font></strong></span><br>

<br>
Getting lonely in this 128 by 128 tile world? Well say hello to these fresh meats! I mean Animals.<br>
<br>
Cows, Pigs, and sheep spawn on grass in the overworld. Peaceful animals that give food and resources that is required for beds, looms, and leather armor.<br>
<br>
Pigs drop raw porkchops to eat. Cows drop raw beef to eat and leather to make leather armor. Sheep drop their wool to make all sorts of items. Raw Beef and Porkchops can be cooked in the Oven with 1 coal for each.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:large"><font style="color:#bf4000"><strong class="bbc">Loom:</strong></font></span><br>
----------<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/20tuM.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
The loom is a new crafting station that is crafted by 10 wood and 5 wool. It is the station to craft the colored wool, beds, cloth, beds, and Leather armor.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FppJp.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
<br>
Well I hope you guys enjoy the update! (and playminicraft.com v2.0 also).<br>

<br>
<strong class="bbc">Old stuff:</strong><br>
<div class="spoiler-button-wrapper"><a class="button">Spoiler (click to hide)</a></div><div class="spoiler" data-spoiler-title="" style="display: block;"><br>
<br>
<font style="color:#ffa500"><span style="font-size:xx-large">Test 1.3.1 update!</span></font><br>
<br>
This is just a small update for implementing some features my partner dillgy10 added.<br>
<br>
<em class="bbc"><strong class="bbc">*Removed The instant kill and replaced it with a pause menu</strong></em><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:small"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#48d1cc">Pause Menu</font><br>
------------------------</strong></span><br>
<br>
The Instant kill feature is replaced by the new pause menu.<br>
<br>
Now pressing N/Esc will bring up the pause menu and will let you choose one of 3 options.<br>
<br>
C to return to the game.<br>
<br>
X to quit the game, Goes back to the menu.<br>
<br>
And Z to restart, This restarts the game and loads a new map with your world settings.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/vFrlB.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Now we all make mistakes, that's why we have a confirmation menu with it.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/e4N2x.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
I'm glad he implemented the pause menu, I might make a option to change difficulty in-game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:small"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#48d1cc">Set home</font><br>
------------------------</strong></span><br>
<br>
Hate traveling all around the map to look for a couple of resources and waste your time walking back? Well this is the feature for you!<br>
<br>
Just press 1 (on the keyboard not keypad) to set your home position and press H to return there.<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">[Note: You cannot set your home underground.]</strong></font><br>
<font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">[Note: You cannot use this feature underground.]</strong></font><br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1EWce.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/m5NCo.png" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
You can use this feature while your being attacked by monsters, or just lost in the thick forest. Returning home uses all your stamina.<br>
<br>
Home positions do not carry over maps. You need to set it again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, that's it for this small update. Now to work on Test 1.4!<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#0f0"><span style="font-size:xx-large">Test 1.3 update!</span></font><br>
<br>
<em class="bbc"><strong class="bbc">*Fixed a Bug where the game would freeze if you tried to respawn on any level besides the surface.<br>
<br>
*Reduced lava in the deepest level to cut down lag<br>
<br>
*Redesigned the Hub to be more transparent.<br>
<br>
*You can press N or Esc to Kill yourself incase you get stuck.<br>
<br>
*You can now press F3 to show your FPS<br>
<br>
*Creepers now have a longer explosion range<br>
<br>
*I implemented a feature where wherever you spawn into a 3x3 grid of grass (and a tree) so that you don't spawn in the middle of rock, water or lava.<br>
<font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">[Bug: These patches seems to duplicate on the map, It's not game-braking, but don't seem to be surprised if you see more than one.]</strong></font><br>
<br>
*Enemies no longer spawn on Farmland/crops, because that was a just stupid of notch.</strong></em><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:small"><strong class="bbc"><font style="color:#ffa500">Day/Night System</font><br>
------------------------</strong></span><br>
<br>
Because every mod of Minicraft needs one! But unlike others, I don't use the Fog of war. I actually took my time and recolored all the terrain on the surface to make it look nice.<br>
<br>
Day/night lasts 14 minutes and has 4 stages (Sunrise, Day, Sunset, Night).<br>
<br>
<br>
Day lasts 7 minutes<br>
<br>
Sunrise/Sunset lasts 1 minute<br>
<br>
Night lasts 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
You start at sunrise, so you have a total of 9 minutes of time before mobs start spawning at the surface.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://makeagif.com/media/1-21-2012/AokZKr.gif" width="" height="" alt=""><br>
<br>
Enemy mobs only come out at night on the surface, they spawn at all times at the sky/underground.<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">[Note: Since There is no way to light up the night at the moment, You can place down Stone Bricks to prevent them from spawning (Though they still can walk on it).]</strong></font><br>

Yep, Now when you press "Start Game" You are brought to this menu which you can choose your difficulty.<br>
<br>
The only thing that changes with difficulty is Mob health, Mob Damage, and Mob Drops.<br>
<br>

<br>
Antidious is a short story I wrote for the new Readable Books (Currently the only story book).<br>
<br>
This book has a 1 in 15 chance of dropping on Easy, 1 in 20 on Normal, and 1 in 30 on Hard mode.<br>
<br>
I won't give any spoilers about it, but it's based on A famous Minecraft Youtuber <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AntVenom" target=""><font style="color:#00f"><u><strong class="bbc">Antvenom</strong></u></font></a>. The story would make a lot more sense if you know about him and his hatred against cows.<br>
<br>
Just attack with the book to activate it. Press Left and Right to change pages, and press X to exit.<br>
<br>
<font style="color:#f00"><strong class="bbc">[Note: You can skip the night by waiting 5 minutes with the book open. But this is considered cheating for me, but I don't really care.)</strong></font><br>

<br>
<font style="color:#0000cd"><strong class="bbc">Also, you notice that the game is quiet. I am pretty good with coding &amp; art, and a deciet writer.

<br>
<font style="color:#0000cd"><strong class="bbc">1.) It must be made by <u>you</u>. serosuly, I don't want any copyright issues.</strong></font><br>

<font style="color:#0000cd"><strong class="bbc">2.) It must be lyricless and fits the atmosphere of the game. No heavy metal or screamo or anything that would just be off in the game. </strong></font><br>
