            <p>
                MiniMods is a Modloader which loads mods for Minicraft(+). And it is based on Minicraft+, which is a modded version of Minicraft that adds many more features to the original version.
                This Modloader is not based on any Modloader API (Fabric, Forge(FML), etc.), so there is no need to use any dependency with basic mods.
            </p>
            For the <a href="https://github.com/BenChueng0422/Minicraft-Plus-Mods/releases/" style="text-decoration: none;">releases</a>, you do not need to use other executable files.
